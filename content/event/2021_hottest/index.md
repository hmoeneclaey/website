summary:

abstract: We report on our investigations linking parametricity and cubical structures. Our slogan is that cubical models of type theory are cofreely parametric. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Using various notions of parametricity and of models of type theory, we will present the following as cofreely parametric. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Categories with Families (CwF) of semi-cubical types, with Pi-types and a universe.  <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Categories of cubical object, for any kind of cubes.  <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; * CwF of setoids (here seen as 1-dimensional Kan objects), with a univalent universe of propositions.  <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;* Clans of Reedy fibrant objects (work in progress).  <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp; * Tribes of Kan cubical objects (work in progress).  <br/> We will introduce a notion called interpretation, used to build these cofree objects.  <br />
