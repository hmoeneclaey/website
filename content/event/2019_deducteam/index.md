summary: We formalize monoids up to coherent homotopy in Agda, using two level type theory.

abstract: When defining a monoid structure on an arbitrary type in HoTT, one should require a multiplication that is not only homotopy-associative, but also has an infinite tower of higher homotopies. For example in dimension two one should have a condition similar to Mac Laneâ€™s pentagon for monoidal categories. We call such a monoid a monoid up to coherent homotopy. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; The goal of my internship in Stockholm was to formalize them in Agda. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is well-known that infinite towers of homotopies are hard to handle in plain HoTT, so we postulate a variant of two-level type theory, with a strict equality and an interval type. Then we adapt the set-theoretical treatment of monoids up to coherent homotopy using operads as presented by Clemens Berger and Ieke Moerdijk. Our main results are <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Monoids up to coherent homotopy are invariant under homotopy equivalence <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) Loop spaces are monoids up to coherent homotopy. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; In this talk I will present the classical theory of monoids up to coherent homotopy, and indicates how two-level type theory can be used to formalize it.
